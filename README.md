React Application for generating a prime table.

Navigate to primes/src/client/ location to view in browser.

I have already bundled up the application with a production build using webpack but if you would like to install node_modules and do so yourself please follow the below instruction:

 1.To install node_modules please run the below command from the root directory.
  'npm install'

 2.The build is done using webpack. To build please run one of the following commands depending on environment:
  'npm run build' (to run a production build) or 'npm run dev' (if you want to produce a development build - easier to check code in the console).

For development purposes I also included a command to keep watch on file changes ('npm run dev:watch'). This will automatically build on each code change within the root directory.

The development files will be found in src/client/app
The production bundle will be found in src/client/public
